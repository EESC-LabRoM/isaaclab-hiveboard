"""RL (teacher/student) configuration for the fixed-base ANYmal + DynaArm M30 thread.

Same MDP as the ball valve (``tasks/anymal/ball_valve_rl``): time-indexed
tracking of a cuRobo expert bank, a privileged ``teacher`` group and a
deployable ``policy`` group. What changes is the part (:data:`M30_THREAD_TASK`):
the M30 nut starts two turns out and the expert runs it down until seated
(``RevoluteJoint`` 0 -> -4 pi, ``PrismaticJoint`` 7 mm -> 0), regrasping it
every 120 deg (``tasks/anymal/screw.py``): grasp, turn, let go, back off 3 cm,
grasp again. The nut's travel follows its angle through the thread's mimic
constraint, so resets write both joints (``ValveTaskCfg.coupled_joint_name``),
and the nut counts as held while both pads touch it (the hand turns away from
the fixed grasp pose with the nut).

The bank is built with::
