"""Per-episode variations of the scripted cuRobo expert, for a diverse expert bank.

A reset event (:class:`sample_expert_diversity`) samples, per environment,
the values in :data:`EXPERT_DIVERSITY` and writes them into the
``pose_command`` handlers before they plan:

* ``turn_rate`` - the valve arc's angular speed [rad/s];
* ``reach_scale`` - a factor on the approach and grasp segments' speeds;
* ``grasp_shift`` - where along the lever the TCP grasps [m];
* ``grasp_roll`` - the grasp's rotation about the lever's long axis [rad],
  i.e. the side the hand comes from around the bar;
* ``turn_overshoot`` - not sampled: how far past 90 deg the arc runs [rad].
  Under load the lever lags the hand by ~0.02 rad per N·m (mostly the arm's
  compliance), so the expert turns further the harder the valve
  (:func:`turn_overshoot`) and the valve's end stop holds the lever at open.
  Without it the expert opened 38% of the 3-4 N·m valves; with it 85%.

With ``wrist_branch_nearest`` the cuRobo reach and retreat plan to the IK
branch nearest the arm's current joints: the usual one (wrist flexion
negative) or its wrist-flipped twin with the same hand pose (forearm turned by
pi, wrist flexion negated, wrist rotation by pi; the DynaArm has no other
branch within its limits). Which one the expert takes then follows from the
start posture (some start flipped, see ``mdp.reset_joints_from_postures``),
which the student observes; a randomly drawn branch would not be learnable.

The grasp offset is applied in the grasp goal's frame: the shift along
``grasp_axes[0]`` and the roll about ``grasp_axes[1]``. On the ball valve both
are the goal's ``y`` axis, which runs along the lever (the goal sits 6 cm out
along it from the valve axis). The approach goals before the grasp get the
same offset expressed from their own frame, so the final approach keeps its
direction relative to the grasp.
