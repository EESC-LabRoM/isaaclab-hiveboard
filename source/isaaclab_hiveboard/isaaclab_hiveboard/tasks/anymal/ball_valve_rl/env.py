"""RL (teacher/student) configuration for the fixed-base ANYmal + DynaArm ball valve.

The scene, robot, valve and domain randomization match the scripted-expert
task in ``tasks/anymal/ball_valve``; what changes is the MDP:

* Action: integrated arm joint-position increments (7 = 6 arm + 1 gripper).
  The gripper is binary (negative closes), ramped like the expert's.
* ``teacher`` observations: privileged simulator state, used by PPO for both
  actor and critic.
* ``policy`` observations: what the robot has at deployment - arm encoders,
  gripper angle, forward-kinematics TCP pose, previous action, and the
  registered valve pose with a per-episode registration error - stacked over
  a short history. The student is distilled from the teacher on these.
