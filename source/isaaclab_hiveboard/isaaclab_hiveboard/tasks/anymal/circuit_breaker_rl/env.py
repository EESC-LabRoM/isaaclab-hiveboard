"""RL (teacher/student) configuration for the fixed-base ANYmal + DynaArm circuit breaker.

Same MDP as the ball valve (``tasks/anymal/ball_valve_rl``): time-indexed
tracking of a cuRobo expert bank, a privileged ``teacher`` group and a
deployable ``policy`` group. What changes is the mechanism
(:data:`CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TASK`): the breaker's toggle lever is too small to
pinch (2.3 cm long, 2 cm thick; the 2F-140 bottoms out ~24 mm apart), so
the expert closes its hand into a fist, comes in 7 cm below the pivot and
pushes straight up past it to 7 cm above, which flips the lever from its down
stop (``RevoluteJoint`` +30 deg) to its up stop (-30 deg), then backs off to
the approach point. The pushed lever runs ahead of the hand to its stop, so
it counts as switched once a pad has touched it (``ValveTaskCfg.push``).

The bank is built with::
