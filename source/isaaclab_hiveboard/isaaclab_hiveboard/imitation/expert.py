    """Turn the task's sequential pose command into an action vector.

    The HiveBoard tasks are already solved by :class:`SequentialPoseCommand`,
    whose waypoint handlers advance on *measured* TCP error rather than on a
    step counter. That property is what makes this class usable as a DAgger
    expert and not merely as a demonstration replayer: query it at a state the
    learner drifted into and the command term, having never seen its waypoint
    reached, keeps pointing at the pose the learner failed to achieve.

    One caveat worth knowing before trusting the labels blindly: the rotating
    handlers (``RotateFrame``, and the screw coupling) integrate their target
    against wall-clock ``step_dt``, not against measured progress. If a learner
    stalls mid-turn, those targets keep advancing and the label degrades into
    "catch up to where the bulb should be by now". The stall watchdog on the
    command term reports when this happens.
